    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players); // [Wes, Sarah, Ryan, Poppy]
    console.log(team); // [Wes, Sarah, Ryan, Poppy]

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array.
    console.log(players); // [Wes, Sarah, Ryan, Lux]
    console.log(team); // [Wes, Sarah, Ryan, Lux]

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // We can take a copy with splice()
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players); // [Wes, Sarah, Ryan, Poppy]
    console.log(team2); // [Wes, Sarah, Ryan, Lux]

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Poor man's deep clone
    const captain3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
